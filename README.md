# LearningWebDev_Bootstrap

## 2022 02 26 | Intro
This Repo is my study into the Bootstrapt framework.  My first intro to BS was through CodeUp coding bootcamp.  Now, I will dive a bit further using several tutorials found through Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, and others.  This weekend, I will be running through the LI Leraning Bootstrap 5 Essential Training tutorial by Ray Villalobos. This is a four plus hour lesson plan that will likely take me the next two days.  Any LL will be posted here and in my CodeUp Repor (for quick ref).
