# LearningWebDev_Bootstrap

## 2022 03 04 | Udemy
For the last week, I have bbe going through an udemy course taught by Brad Traversy.  The part of this course covered the same topics as the LI Learning Bootstrap lesson.  Although, I think this course did a much better job in explaining each part of Bootstrap.  

### 1000 | Completed
Completed the first project.  I learned several things.  It was helpful to put into practice what the lectures had spoken about.  It was better to make mistakes and find out why errors occurred.  I still have a bug in the smooth scrolling JS script.  I think it has to do with the JQuery attachment (CDN) link.  The example works when we use older BS and JQ CDN links.  Although it does not work at the moment, I expect I can learn how to make a better script when I take the time to understand it better (probably with only JS and BOM manip).

## 2022 02 26 | Intro
This Repo is my study into the Bootstrap framework.  My first intro to BS was through CodeUp coding bootcamp.  Now, I will dive a bit further using several tutorials found through Udemy, LinkedIn Learning, and others.  This weekend, I will be running through the LI Learning Bootstrap 5 Essential Training tutorial by Ray Villalobos. This is a four plus hour lesson plan that will likely take me the next two days.  Any LL will be posted here and in my CodeUp Report (for quick ref).
